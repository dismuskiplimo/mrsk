"This option controls the vertical stacking order of layers that overlap. In "

"static layers.<br><br>On each slide, the stacking order starts counting from "
"100. Providing a number less than 100 will put the layer behind every other "

"LayerSlider 6 is just the beginning of our awesome new ideas. One of the "

"improve upon existing functionality with an easily maintainable code base. "
"Beyond the predictable feature updates like the complete overhaul of skins, "
"dynamic contents, etc (which will arrive very soon); we already have an "
"experimental offline slider editor and preliminary support for LayerSlider "
"extensions. This later one will soon be available for anyone to extend the "
